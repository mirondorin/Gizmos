Making sense of the name codes:
"Tier level of card" + "card number" + "card type"
card number = counting up->down & left->right from gizmos distribution pdf
card types :
A - archive
P - pick
B - build
C - converter
U - upgrade

Format for card cost : [R, Y, U, B]
R - red,
Y - yellow,
U - blue,
B - black
The cost of a card is considered to be paid if array looks like [0, 0, 0, 0]

setBuildCost(tier, cost)
reduceArchiveBuild(cost) - reduces building cost of gizmos from archive by cost
reduceTierBuild([tier, cost]) - reduces building cost of buildings of tier, by cost
