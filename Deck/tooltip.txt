Making sense of the name codes:
"Tier level of card" + "card number" + "card type"
card number = counting up->down & left->right from gizmos distribution pdf
card types :
A - archive
P - pick
B - build
C - converter
U - upgrade

Format for card cost : [R, Y, U, B]
R - red,
Y - yellow,
U - blue,
B - black
The cost of a card is considered to be paid if array looks like [0, 0, 0, 0]

setBuildCost(tier, cost)
reduceArchiveBuild(cost) - reduces building cost of gizmos from archive by cost
reduceTierBuild([tier, cost]) - reduces building cost of buildings of tier, by cost

---- FUNCTIONS THAT CHECK IF PLAYER HAS MET CERTAIN CONDITION ----
# Checks if player archived this turn
has_archived()
# Checks if player picked energy of certain type this turn
has_picked(arr) arr[i] in range [0,3] = type of energy. Max size of arr = 2
# Check if player built building of certain type this turn 
has_built(arr) arr[i] in range [0,3] = type of building. Max size of arr = 2
# Checks if player has energy of type to convert
has_energy(arr) arr[i] in range [0,3] = type of energy. Max size of arr = 2. I have no idea how to implement the 2 effect converters
